Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** for building the psychic ability testing app based on the provided requirements. The plan includes main tasks, technical considerations, and milestones to ensure efficient development.

## **Project Plan: Psychic Ability Testing App**

---

### **1. Project Overview**
**Goal**: Build a web-based app to test psychic ability using a word selection mechanic. The app will calculate a "Psychic Score" based on user accuracy and feature a retro pixel design.

**Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

---

### **2. Main Tasks**
#### **Phase 1: Setup and Initialization**
1. **Set up the project structure**:
   - Create folders for `css`, `js`, and `assets` (if needed).
   - Create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files.

2. **Define the word list**:
   - Create a predefined list of words (e.g., `["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"]`) in `script.js`.

3. **Import the pixel font**:
   - Use Google Fonts (e.g., `Press Start 2P` or `VT323`) and link it in the HTML.

---

#### **Phase 2: Build the Interface**
1. **HTML structure**:
   - Create a header with the app title.
   - Add a side panel to display all possible word options.
   - Create a main area for prompts and user interaction.
   - Add a score display section for the "Psychic Score".
   - Include a footer with the external link: `<a href="https://pixel-oracle.com/" target="_blank">Visit Pixel Oracle</a>`.

2. **CSS styling**:
   - Apply the pixel font to the entire app.
   - Use a retro color palette (e.g., dark background with neon text).
   - Style the side panel, main area, and score display for consistency.

---

#### **Phase 3: Core Functionality**
1. **Random word selection**:
   - Create a JavaScript function to pick 2 unique words from the list using `Math.random()`.

2. **User interaction**:
   - Display all word options in the side panel as clickable buttons.
   - Allow the user to select 2 words for each test.

3. **Scoring logic**:
   - Compare the user’s selections to the hidden words.
   - Assign 1 point for each correct selection.
   - Calculate the total score after 5 tests (max score: 10).

---

#### **Phase 4: Testing and Debugging**
1. **Test the app**:
   - Verify that the random word selection works correctly.
   - Ensure the scoring logic updates the "Psychic Score" accurately.
   - Check the design for responsiveness and consistency.

2. **Debug and refine**:
   - Fix any issues with user interaction or score calculation.
   - Ensure the app works across different browsers.

---

### **3. Technical Considerations**
1. **HTML**:
   - Use semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
   - Structure the side panel using `<ul>` or `<div>` elements.

2. **CSS**:
   - Use Flexbox or Grid for layout.
   - Add hover effects and transitions for buttons.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - Use event listeners to handle user selections.
   - Avoid global variables where possible for cleaner code.

---

### **4. Timeline**
- **Day 1**: Project setup, word list, and font import.
- **Day 2**: HTML structure and basic CSS styling.
- **Day 3**: JavaScript functionality (word selection, user interaction, scoring).
- **Day 4**: Testing, debugging, and final refinements.
- **Day 5**: Final review and deployment (if applicable).

---

### **5. Deliverables**
1. A fully functional web-based app with:
   - A retro pixel design.
   - Accurate "Psychic Score" calculation.
   - A working side panel and user interaction flow.
2. Clean, well-documented code.
3. A live demo or deployment (if required).
